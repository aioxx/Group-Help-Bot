The bot files similar to group help have been updated to the second version ‚ù§Ô∏è

#Latest_version üî•

In a better and better arrangement

Supports 3 languages: Arabic, English, and Persian ‚ô°

I added a new admin panel for you as well ‚ô°

Modification only in the super_api.php file ‚ô°

Put your token, your hands, and the required information, and good health to you ‚ô°

By the way, the files are old and I don‚Äôt know who I corrected, and there were many errors in them. I developed them, updated them, and arranged them with the help of my brother Muhammad. May God give him good health.
